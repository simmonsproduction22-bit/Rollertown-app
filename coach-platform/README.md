# Coach Booking

A booking and payments site for private coaches. Clients buy lesson packages, then book, reschedule and cancel lessons online. Package money is **held by Stripe and released to the coach one lesson at a time** as lessons are marked done.

Built for one coach first, with multiple coaches supported from day one: each coach gets their own page at `/<their-name>`, their own clients and their own payouts.

## How the money works

```
Client buys "4 lessons for $240" by card
        │
        ▼
$240 lands in the PLATFORM Stripe balance (payouts set to manual, so it stays there)
        │
        │  Coach marks lesson 1 Done / No-show / Late cancel
        ▼
$60 transfers to the COACH's connected Stripe account → their bank (daily)
```

- Each lesson releases `price ÷ lessons`. The last lesson picks up any rounding, so the total always matches exactly.
- **Canceled in time**: the lesson goes back on the client's balance and nothing is released.
- **Refund**: refunds whatever is still held and cancels that package's upcoming lessons. Lessons already done stay paid.
- **Expired package**: the coach chooses **Keep** (release the rest) or **Refund**.
- **Paid in person** (cash, Zelle, Venmo): the coach adds the package by hand. The client gets the lessons and nothing is held.
- A Stripe outage never blocks marking a lesson. Releases queue up and send on the next try, and each transfer is idempotent, so nothing pays twice.

Stripe fees: about 2.9% + 30¢ per card payment (about $7.26 on $240). Transfers and payouts to the coach are free on standard Connect pricing; check your Stripe pricing page.

## Pages

| URL | Who | What |
|---|---|---|
| `/<slug>` | Clients | Coach bio, packages, policies; sign up, buy, book, reschedule, cancel |
| `/admin` | Coach | Schedule, close-out queue, clients, money, packages, weekly hours, time off, settings |
| `/` | Anyone | Redirects to the coach when there's only one; otherwise a list of coaches |

## Packages, groups and corporate

- **Private packages**: one price for N lessons. The **Packages** tab has a one-tap starter set: Single $125, 5-Pack $575 ($115 each), 10-Pack $1,000 ($100 each).
- **Small groups** (type "Small group"): the price is **per person** with a min/max headcount (starter: $50/person, 3–6 people). One client picks the headcount and pays for everyone, e.g. 4 people = $200. The booked lesson shows as "Group of 4", and closing it out releases the full $200.
- **Corporate wellness**: a "Request a quote" form on the coach page sends requests to the **Requests** tab. **Create offer** makes a private package with a custom price and a link only that company can open (it's never listed publicly). They sign up through the link and pay by card like any other package, and it releases per session.
- Clients with more than one kind of lesson left (say a private lesson and a group of 3) pick which one when booking.

## Booking rules (set per coach in Settings)

Lesson length, start-time spacing, break between lessons, minimum notice, how far ahead clients can book, and the free cancel/reschedule window (default 24h). Inside the window, clients see "contact your coach" instead of the buttons, and the coach can mark it a **Late cancel**, which counts as used and releases the money.

## Setup

### 1. Deploy on Netlify
Create a **new Netlify site** from this repo with **Base directory = `coach-platform`**. Netlify Database is provisioned automatically, and migrations in `netlify/database/migrations` run on deploy.

### 2. Stripe
1. Create a Stripe account for the business and turn on **Connect** (Dashboard → Connect → Get started, choose "Platform").
2. **Set the platform's payout schedule to Manual** (Settings → Payouts). This is what keeps client money held. Without it, Stripe sweeps the balance to your bank and the hold does nothing.
3. Add a webhook endpoint `https://<your-site>/api/stripe/webhook` with these events:
   `checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`, `checkout.session.async_payment_failed`, `checkout.session.expired`, `account.updated`.
   Enable "Listen to events on Connected accounts" as well, for `account.updated`.
4. In Netlify → Site configuration → Environment variables, add:
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: `sk_test_...` while testing, `sk_live_...` when live
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: `whsec_...` from the webhook you created
5. Redeploy.

### 3. Create your coach account
Go to `/admin` → **Create an account**. The first account needs no invite code. Then:
1. **Settings**: bio, headline, booking rules.
2. **Packages**: add packages. Keep use-by at **90 days or less**, because Stripe limits how long funds can be held before transfer.
3. **Availability**: weekly hours.
4. **Money** → **Connect payouts**: Stripe collects your business checking and ID. Released lessons wait until this is done, then send automatically.

### Adding more coaches later
Set `COACH_SIGNUP_CODE` in Netlify env vars and share it. Each coach signs up at `/admin`, gets their own page and connects their own bank. To take a cut, set `platform_fee_bps` on their row (for example `500` = 5% of each released lesson; it stays in the platform balance).

## Local development

```bash
cd coach-platform
npm install
# any Postgres with the migration applied:
psql "$DB" -f netlify/database/migrations/20261105000000_init.sql
COACH_DB_URL="$DB" PAYMENTS_MODE=fake node scripts/dev-server.mjs   # http://localhost:8888
COACH_DB_URL="$DB" PAYMENTS_MODE=fake npm test                      # wipes the database's tables
```

`PAYMENTS_MODE=fake` simulates Stripe (checkout succeeds instantly and transfers are pretend). Never set it on the live site.

## Not built yet
- Email/text reminders and booking notifications
- Self-serve "forgot password" (for now the coach resets it from the client's page in the dashboard)
- Google Calendar sync
- Undoing a lesson that has already paid out (do it in the Stripe dashboard with a transfer reversal)
